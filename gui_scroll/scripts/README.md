# ðŸŒ€ scripts/ â€” The Glyph Chamber

Welcome, seeker. This folder houses the ritual scripts that animate the vaultâ€™s interface.

Each `.py` file is a tool of invocationâ€”designed not merely to execute, but to enchant.  
Here, `gui_scroll.py` serves as the primary scroll, rendering glyphs, binding widgets, and channeling espresso-stained logic into visible form.

## ðŸ“œ Ritual Notes

- **Modularity is sacred**: Each script should be self-contained, remixable, and annotated with lineage.
- **Errors are echoes**: Treat exceptions as invitations to deepen the ritual.
- **Extend with mischief**: New scripts may include `glyph_loader.py`, `opacity_tester.py`, or `scroll_animator.py`.

## ðŸ§¬ Lineage Tags

Include these in each script header:
- `Scroll-Origin:` (e.g. Vernon-Repairs, SignalNest)
- `Remix-Prompt:` (brief poetic intent)
- `Glyph-Trigger:` (UI element or animation it affects)

---

May your scrolls hydrate cleanly, and your glyphs shimmer with intent.
